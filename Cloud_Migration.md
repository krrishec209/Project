7 Cloud Migration Strategies Every Cloud Engineer Should Know 
(with scenario questions for interviews)

Cloud migration can originate from on-premises infrastructure or from another cloud provider.

And it goes beyond just moving data. 
It's about strategically deciding the best approach for each application and workload.

The goal is to optimize performance, cost, and long-term viability in the cloud.

Here‚Äôs a simple breakdown of the key strategies you should focus on:

1/ Retain (Revisit later) 
‚Ü≥ Keep workloads on-prem if they aren‚Äôt cloud-ready or are still needed locally.
Scenario : You have a critical legacy application with custom hardware dependencies. How would you initially approach its cloud migration?

2/ Retire (Decommission) 
‚Ü≥ Eliminate outdated or unused parts to reduce cost and simplify the system.
Scenario : During an assessment, you identify an old reporting tool used by only a few employees once a month. What's your recommendation?

3/ Repurchase (Drop & Shop) 
‚Ü≥ Replace legacy apps with SaaS alternatives, a fast and cost-effective solution.
Scenario : Your company's on-premise CRM system (example) is outdated and costly to maintain. What quick cloud solution might you consider?

4/ Rehost (Lift & Shift) 
‚Ü≥ Move your application to the cloud as-is, with no code changes needed.
Scenario : A non-critical internal application needs to move to the cloud quickly with minimal disruption. What strategy would you prioritize?

5/ Replatform (Lift, Tinker & Shift) 
‚Ü≥ Make light optimizations before migration, for better performance with minimal effort.
Scenario : You're migrating a web application, and a small change to its database will significantly improve cloud performance. What strategy does this align with?

6/ Relocate (Many Providers) 
‚Ü≥ Change the hosting provider without modifying the app, a quick and simple approach. 
Scenario : Your current cloud provider is increasing prices significantly for a specific set of VMs. How might you address this without rewriting applications?

7/ Refactor (Re-architect) 
‚Ü≥ Redesign your application for cloud-native capabilities, making it scalable and future-ready. 
Scenario : A monolithic, highly scalable customer-facing application is experiencing performance bottlenecks on-prem. What long-term cloud strategy would you propose?.

Beyond these strategies themselves, successful cloud migration also focuses on:
- thorough assessment, 
- understanding dependencies, 
- meticulous planning, 
- and continuous optimization 

Just remember: successful migration isn't just about the tools, but the approach. 

Very important to understands the "why" behind each strategy ‚Äî not just the "how."
