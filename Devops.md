1. How do you uncommit the changes that have already been pushed to GitHub?
2. If there is suddenly the file is deleted in git how do you get it back?
3. Can you increase the size of the root volume without shutting down
the instance?
4. If you lost the .pem file then how will you connect to EC2?
5. S3 bucket having a policy for only read-only but you’re having full access for you? Can you modify s3 objects?
6. Difference between Classic ELB and Application ELB?
7. How many subnets are assigned to the routing table?
8. In your VPC all IPs are finished you require resources how to provision it?
9. Are you only using cloud watch for monitoring?
10. If you are using load balancing in 2 availability zones then which load
balancer you should use?
11. can you write docker file where Linux env condition deploy static webserver
12. Is it possible to run any VM in AWS without creating any EC2 instance ?
13. I want to create a pipeline in Jenkins which needs to have 10 different stages and based on my input it needs to execute some stages not every stages how you will configure that.
14. What are the Terraform modules? Have used any modules in the project?
15. Is it possible to configure communication between 2 servers those
are having private access
16. What happens when you delete /var/lib/docker/overlay?
17. Write a simple script that calls with “Foo” prints “bar” and when called with “bar” prints “foo”. Every other option should print “Try
again”?
18. Tell all the scenarios too implement the security in Kubernetes.
19. Your EKS application is experiencing higher than expected traffic.
How would you automatically scale the Pods?
20. Your team needs to be alerted when the CPU usage of any Pod in your EKS cluster exceeds 80% for more than 5 minutes. How would you set this up?
21. Your team wants a Grafana dashboard to visualize the HTTP request latency of your applications running in EKS. How would you achieve this?
