Its because of 'spring-boot-starter-web' dependency as it includes automatic support for serialization and de-serialization of JSON.

Behind the scenes, Spring Boot uses Jackson as its default library for handling JSON.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐉𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐨?
1. Serialization : Converts Java objects to JSON (during API response) 
2. De-Serialization : Converts JSON to Java objects (API requests)

So, if you are working with REST APIs using Spring Boot, you have probably used Jackson without even realizing it !

Have you ever deployed a Java application on a Windows server and thought:
“What happens if the server restarts or someone closes the console window?”

That’s where running your JAR as a Windows service comes in.

By running your Java app as a Windows service, you ensure:
✅ Automatic startup on boot
✅ Restart on failure
✅ No need to manually start the app
✅ Cleaner, more reliable production setup

💡 Use cases:
1. Background tasks (e.g., schedulers, message consumers)
2. Microservices
3. APIs that need 24/7 uptime
4. Internal tools with backend logic


🛑 A regular java -jar app.jar command runs in a terminal and stops if:
1. The session closes
2. The user logs out
3. The system reboots

𝐉𝐀𝐑 (𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐀𝐑𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐯𝐞) :
• Used for : Standalone applications and libraries
• Structure : Flat archive containing compiled .class files, resources 
• Execution : Can be executed using java -jar if the manifest specifies the Main-Class
•Spring Boot Behavior : Spring Boot creates executable JARs with an embedded servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty) — enabling the app to run independently without needing external deployment.

✅ Ideal for microservices and cloud-native deployments where each service is packaged and deployed independently.

𝐖𝐀𝐑 (𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐑𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐯𝐞) :
• Used for : Web applications targeting external application servers
• Structure : Follows a stricter directory layout (e.g., WEB-INF/classes, WEB-INF/lib)
• Deployment : Requires a Servlet container (like Apache Tomcat, WildFly, or WebLogic) to deploy the WAR file
• Spring Boot Behavior : Can be configured to build a WAR instead of a JAR (by extending Spring Boot Servelet Initializer) when integration with an existing app server is required.

✅ Useful in environments where a central servlet container manages multiple web apps.

Conclusion:
Spring Boot favors JAR files for simplicity and portability. WAR is still supported when integration with traditional enterprise app servers is required.
In most modern Spring Boot projects (especially Microservices), JAR is the preferred choice.

Singleton Scope in Spring for Efficient Bean Management : 

In Spring, the default scope for beans is singleton. This means that only one instance of a bean is created and shared across the entire application context.

Explanation:
1 .animal1 and animal2 are created using the new keyword, so they are different instances.

2. animal3 and animal4 are fetched from the Spring container, which uses the singleton scope by default. This means Spring returns the same instance of the bean for both animal3 and animal4, resulting in identical hash codes.

🧵 From main() to Microservices: Why Simple Java Programs Stop and Spring Boot Apps Keep Running

When I first started learning Java, I wrote simple programs like this:
public class MyFirstProgram {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
 }
}
👉 It printed output, then exited immediately.
This made perfect sense — you write code, it executes line by line, and the JVM exits once it’s done.

🤔 But Then Came Spring Boot...
I built my first backend app using Spring Boot and noticed something very different.
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
 }
}
I ran it — and it didn’t stop! It kept running until I manually terminated it.
Even stranger, some methods didn’t run at all — until I called an API like /hello.

 That got me thinking: Why does this happen?

🔍 What’s Actually Happening Behind the Scenes?

When you build real-world applications (like REST APIs), the structure is very different. Here’s what Spring Boot does:
✅ 1. Starts an Embedded Web Server
(Spring Boot uses Tomcat or Jetty by default)
This turns your app into a web server that can listen to incoming HTTP requests — just like a website.
✅ 2. Initializes the Spring Context
It scans for beans, controllers, services, and loads the entire application structure.
✅ 3. Waits for Requests
The app stays alive, listening on port 8080 (or any custom port you define), ready to respond.

🎯 Execution Flow: Startup vs On-Demand
Let’s break this into two categories:
🔸 Code That Runs on Startup:
main() method
@PostConstruct methods
CommandLineRunner or ApplicationRunner implementations
Auto-configured beans
🔹 Code That Runs On-Demand:
@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc. (i.e., your API methods)
These are not executed until an actual request comes in

🔁 Real Example:
@RestController
public class HelloController {

 @GetMapping("/hello")
 public String sayHello() {
 System.out.println("sayHello() called");
 return "Hello from API!";
 }
}

App starts ✅
This method doesn't run yet ❌
You call /hello in Postman or browser ➡️ Method runs ✅
This is the key difference: your code now lives inside a continuously running application, and only runs when a request triggers it.

🧠 Final Thoughts
This transition — from simple main() programs to real-world request-driven applications — is a huge milestone in backend development.
Understanding how your app waits, listens, and responds is essential when moving into frameworks like Spring Boot, Java EE, or even Node.js and Django.
If you're just starting this journey, remember:
Not all Java code runs immediately — some of it is waiting for a reason. 🔁

SpringBoot keeps running only if you use the spring-boot-starter-web dependency. If you use spring-boot-starter instead, without the -web part, no web server will be started, and the SpringBoot app will terminate, just like the simple program with the main method. This way it's also possible to implement Batch Job Applications with Spring Boot, which will terminate when their work is done.

******************

Spring beans don’t all behave the same way. 

Their scope decides how often they’re created, how long they live, and who gets to use them.

Let’s break it down.

𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲:

It is the default scope. Creates a single, shared instance per container, which is cached and reused for all requests.

Lifecycle: Created at container startup (eager) or on first use (lazy); reused for every injection.

Used for stateless services or shared configuration.

✅ Pros
- Memory-efficient
- Shared and consistent instance

❌ Cons
- Not thread-safe for mutable state
- Shared state may cause unintended side effects

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲: 

It creates a new instance each time the bean is requested. 

Lifecycle: Created at injection time. Spring doesn't manage the full lifecycle, only creating and configuring the bean. Cleanup is the user’s responsibility.

Used for non-thread-safe components, multi-threaded, or stateful logic.

✅ Pros
- Each request gets a fresh instance
- Safer for mutable state and concurrency
- Eliminate shared state concerns

❌ Cons
- Higher memory usage
- Spring does not manage the full lifecycle

𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲:

Creates one instance per HTTP request (only in Web-aware ApplicationContext).

Lifecycle: Created at the start of the request, destroyed at the end.

Used for web layer components tied to a single request.

✅ Pros
- Isolated per HTTP request
- No risk of data leaking between requests

❌ Cons
- Requires a web-aware context
- Needs proxies when injected into singleton beans

𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲:

Creates one instance per HTTP session (only in Web-aware ApplicationContext).

Lifecycle: Created on session creation and destroyed on session timeout/invalidation.

Used for user-specific data that persists across multiple requests.

✅ Pros
- Tracks user-specific state across requests
- Session-bound lifecycle

❌ Cons
- Memory overhead and leaks if sessions linger
- Stale references after session timeout

𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲:

Creates one instance per ServletContext (only in Web-aware ApplicationContext).

Lifecycle: Exists for the lifetime of the web application.

Used for application-wide state or resources.

✅ Pros
- Shared across all users and sessions
- Centralized configuration

❌ Cons
- Shared state can be risky if it’s not thread-safe
- Requires a servlet container

𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁:

Creates one instance per WebSocket (only in Web-aware ApplicationContext).

Lifecycle: Managed by the WebSocket session lifecycle.

Used for maintaining stateful interaction over a WebSocket connection.

✅ Pros
- Tracks WebSocket user session state
- Useful for real-time communication

❌ Cons
- Requires WebSocket configuration
- Limited to WebSocket-based systems

Choosing the right scope saves headaches later, such as during debugging, memory leaks, or thread issues.

Keep this in your toolbox as you build smarter Spring applications.
