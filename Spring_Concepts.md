Spring Boot has revolutionized backend development, making it easier to build production-ready applications. Whether you're preparing for an interview or sharpening your expertise, mastering key concepts is essential

Here are some crucial Spring Boot topics to focus on:-

➥ Spring Boot vs. Spring Framework – Understand the differences & benefits

➥ Auto-Configuration & Starters – Speed up development with built-in features

➥ Embedded Servers – Learn about Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow

➥ Spring Boot Actuator – Monitor and manage applications effortlessly

➥ Security, CORS & Exception Handling – Best practices for real-world scenarios

➥ Spring Profiles & Database Integration – Manage environment-specific configurations.

Its because of 'spring-boot-starter-web' dependency as it includes automatic support for serialization and de-serialization of JSON.

Behind the scenes, Spring Boot uses Jackson as its default library for handling JSON.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐉𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐨?
1. Serialization : Converts Java objects to JSON (during API response) 
2. De-Serialization : Converts JSON to Java objects (API requests)

So, if you are working with REST APIs using Spring Boot, you have probably used Jackson without even realizing it !

Have you ever deployed a Java application on a Windows server and thought:
“What happens if the server restarts or someone closes the console window?”

That’s where running your JAR as a Windows service comes in.

By running your Java app as a Windows service, you ensure:
✅ Automatic startup on boot
✅ Restart on failure
✅ No need to manually start the app
✅ Cleaner, more reliable production setup

💡 Use cases:
1. Background tasks (e.g., schedulers, message consumers)
2. Microservices
3. APIs that need 24/7 uptime
4. Internal tools with backend logic


🛑 A regular java -jar app.jar command runs in a terminal and stops if:
1. The session closes
2. The user logs out
3. The system reboots

𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐁𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐉𝐀𝐑 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐖𝐀𝐑 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 & 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐭

𝐉𝐀𝐑 (𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐀𝐑𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐯𝐞) :
• Used for : Standalone applications and libraries
• Structure : Flat archive containing compiled .class files, resources 
• Execution : Can be executed using java -jar if the manifest specifies the Main-Class
•Spring Boot Behavior : Spring Boot creates executable JARs with an embedded servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty) — enabling the app to run independently without needing external deployment.

✅ Ideal for microservices and cloud-native deployments where each service is packaged and deployed independently.

𝐖𝐀𝐑 (𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐑𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐯𝐞) :
• Used for : Web applications targeting external application servers
• Structure : Follows a stricter directory layout (e.g., WEB-INF/classes, WEB-INF/lib)
• Deployment : Requires a Servlet container (like Apache Tomcat, WildFly, or WebLogic) to deploy the WAR file
• Spring Boot Behavior : Can be configured to build a WAR instead of a JAR (by extending Spring Boot Servelet Initializer) when integration with an existing app server is required.

✅ Useful in environments where a central servlet container manages multiple web apps.

Conclusion:
Spring Boot favors JAR files for simplicity and portability. WAR is still supported when integration with traditional enterprise app servers is required.
In most modern Spring Boot projects (especially Microservices), JAR is the preferred choice.

Singleton Scope in Spring for Efficient Bean Management : 

In Spring, the default scope for beans is singleton. This means that only one instance of a bean is created and shared across the entire application context.

Explanation:
1 .animal1 and animal2 are created using the new keyword, so they are different instances.

2. animal3 and animal4 are fetched from the Spring container, which uses the singleton scope by default. This means Spring returns the same instance of the bean for both animal3 and animal4, resulting in identical hash codes.
