üî• The Top 5 AWS Projects to get you HIRED.

In today's oversaturated market, AWS certifications alone won't cut it anymore. EVERYONE has them.

You must BUILD real-world projects to stand out.

Here are the top 5 AWS projects that will help you land your dream Cloud role.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Static Website Hosting with S3 & CloudFront
Create a lightning-fast personal portfolio by hosting your static files in S3, then add CloudFront for global distribution and HTTPS. The magic sauce? Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy when you push changes, implement origin access identity for security, and use Route 53 for a custom domain. Recruiters love seeing real-world sites they can actually visit!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Tier Web Application with EC2, ALB & RDS
Build a scalable blog platform with EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group behind an Application Load Balancer. Connect to an RDS MySQL database for persistence, implement proper security groups, and set up automated backups. The differentiator? Add CloudWatch alarms and dashboards to demonstrate your operational excellence mindset.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Serverless API Backend with API Gateway, Lambda & DynamoDB
Develop a serverless REST API that tracks fitness activities using API Gateway as your front door, Lambda functions for business logic, and DynamoDB for NoSQL storage. Implement JWT authentication, proper IAM roles with least privilege, and use the AWS SDK effectively. Show off by adding custom authorizers and throttling configurations that prove you understand API security.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Event-Driven Architecture with Amazon EventBridge, Lambda, SQS & SNS
Create an e-commerce order processing system where order placement publishes to EventBridge, triggering Lambdas for inventory checks, SQS for order fulfillment queuing, and SNS for customer notifications. The impressive part? Implement dead-letter queues for error handling, idempotency for reliability, and proper event schemas that demonstrate you understand decoupled architectures.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Containerized Microservices with Amazon ECS
Deploy a weather analytics application as containerized microservices using ECS with Fargate. Build a CI/CD pipeline that builds Docker images, pushes to ECR, and deploys to production with blue/green deployments. Elevate it by implementing service discovery, centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs, and proper task definitions that showcase real-world container orchestration skills.

üí° The SECRET: Build these as a PORTFOLIO that shows progression. Each project demonstrates a deeper understanding of cloud architecture.

üîë The REAL value? Being able to explain WHY you made each architectural decision.
