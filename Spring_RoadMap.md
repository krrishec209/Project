Spring Boot Roadmap — How I'd Start If I Had to Do It All Over Again

When I started learning backend development seriously, Spring Boot felt overwhelming.

But breaking it into small phases made it so much easier to actually build real projects.

Here’s a simple breakdown that I wish I had from Day 1:

PHASE 1: Basics

* Create your first project using Spring Initializr
* Understand Maven and Gradle (build tools)
* Learn about important Annotations
* Setup Profiles for different environments (dev, prod, etc.)
* Work with @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping
* Handle Path Variables and Request Parameters properly
* Connect your project to Databases like H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL
* Explore JpaRepository, CrudRepository for database operations
* Enable Hot Reloading with Spring Boot DevTools
* Understand basics of Spring Batch, Scheduling, and Cron jobs

PHASE 2: Intermediate Level

* Use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler for clean exception management
* Create Custom Error Responses and Exception Classes
* Handle errors globally across your app
* Setup Basic Authentication for your APIs
* Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure stateless sessions
* Learn about HATEOAS (adding hypermedia to your APIs)
* Version your REST APIs (via URI, Parameters, or Headers)
* Write Unit Tests using JUnit + Mockito
* Write Integration Tests with Spring Boot Test
* Test your REST APIs with MockMvc
* Explore Actuator Endpoints for monitoring
* Build your own Custom Health Indicators

PHASE 3: Advanced Level

* Use @Profile to create environment-specific Beans
* Switch profiles easily (dev, test, prod)
* Setup a Spring Cloud Project
* Understand Eureka Server (service registry)
* Register your Microservices with Eureka
* Implement Service Discovery
* Introduction to API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway
* Configure Routes and Filters smartly
* Setup Spring Cloud Config Server
* Manage centralized Configurations across services

PHASE 4: Microservices Deep Dive

* Master Inter-Service Communication basics
* Use RestTemplate for synchronous API calls
* Simplify calls using Feign Client
* Setup Resilience4j for Circuit Breaking and Retry Patterns
* Get started with Distributed Tracing

Small Note: 
When I was learning, I made sure to mix coding with reading/watching content + deep-diving into real GitHub repos. 
It made a huge difference instead of just passively watching tutorials.

If you’re just starting out or feel stuck — trust me, you don’t have to master everything at once.

Pick one phase. 
Build something small. 
Break stuff. 
Learn. 
Repeat.

Consistency >>> Intensity.

Stay curious, stay hungry, and keep building.
