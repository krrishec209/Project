ðŸš€ Reactive Programming in Spring: When and Why?

Reactive programming is more than a buzzwordâ€”it's a paradigm shift for building non-blocking, highly scalable systems.

In this post, I break down:

1. What reactivity really means

2. Why asynchronous processing matters

3. When to use (and when NOT to use) reactive programming

4. How Spring supports this model through WebFlux and Project Reactor

5. Examples of Reactive Controllers and Services

If you're working with high-concurrency microservices, external APIs, or data streams, understanding these concepts can help you make better architectural decisions.

If you want to know more about Spring Framework and Java detailedly, I have a Youtube Channel called: "The Real Code Show", here's the link:
